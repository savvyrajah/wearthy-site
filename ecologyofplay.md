[Applause] where did you like to play as a child as a playground designer and educator over the last decade asked this question a lot it helps us instantly reflect on a simpler time as a child we all know we live in very different times today and the current generation of children are experiencing a childhood like no other in history anyone here above the age of 30 would agree children are playing outdoors less so they're having less freedom less physical activity and becoming more unwell with the world health organization declaring an emergency on the state of children's physical activity and out of 146 countries ranking australia you're at 140th so as parents and caretakers what can we do about it we all want to protect children from harm and we should but when does protection move to over protection as a father myself i know that protection comes from a place of love but it's in recent times it seems like we've moved from protecting children from mostly physical harm into a realm of protecting children with what feels like everything including disappointment disagreements and failure now i'm all for protecting children from harm but we have to ask ourselves what's the cost to that child later in life because it's through dealing with setbacks and failures that turn us into a resilient adult and it's by overcoming failures independently where we learn self-fulfillment a child's intrinsic motivation is to play is to explore experience and experiment it's where they learn not just about themselves but they learn about the world around them learn about their strengths and equally their weaknesses and it's within this learning where they become a happy healthy resilient adult of tomorrow take this seed the growth of this seed is determined by the environment in which it grows if it does not get sun soil and water it will fail to reach its full potential so what environments are we creating for our children to grow if we are constantly standing in front of our children to protect them from bumps and bruises getting dirty getting wet and even getting cold we are blocking their sun for them to grow we need to stop doing the growing for them as a playground consultant designer and educator here in australia and internationally i've been fortunate enough to come across three components that are integral for creating environments for children to thrive just as the seed needs sun soil and water our children need time freedom and possibilities time imagine the impact on a childhood experience if a child spent just half the amount engaged in outdoor play as they do engaged in a screen with research in 2015 finding that children younger than 10 are spending an average of 4.5 hours a day engaged in screen time and as they move into the teen years it's plus seven hours and that's not school work that's not homework that's recreational screen time that's shocking and don't get me wrong i'm not the any anti-screen guy my children get screens but the priority is play freedom they need freedom to engage in the types of play how they choose and the independence that comes along with that independent children make for independent adults and who doesn't want to create independent adults right and thirdly is possibilities possibilities to engage with things within their environment that can be used in different ways so many of us here have suffered the torment of giving a child a gift only for the child to throw out the gift and be more interested in the box why because it is possibilities it's the it's a pirate ship it's a lemonade stand it's the cave it gets them moving not just physically but socially and emotionally as a child diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd i completely get the importance and need to move as a child i was what adults referred to as busy even too busy my business spilled into the classroom and sure enough my parents received that call lucas needs to be tested he's constant looking out the window he's rocking on his chair and his feet are always swinging within days my eight-year-old self i was diagnosed and medicated and my feet stopped swinging it took me nine years after school to discover what i need in my environment to thrive to focus and understand concepts i need to move that's why this is so hard this little this little container to learn i need to be active and if i can build something up to break it down to understand it even better so it's no surprise today i find myself creating environments for all children to move my interest in play began when i started working full time as an outdoor educator i got to see firsthand how some children were anxious and nervous about getting wet getting dirty being challenged and then on the other hand i got to see the types of activities and interactions that spark curiosity and adventure in their eyes i wanted to make it my mission to ignite that spark in as many children as possible so i founded a company designing building play environments for all children to thrive and it can be basic this is a 20-foot container gracefully plonked in the middle of a piazza at a convention center there's six tons of mulch a hundred hay bales and fifty trees that container was filled with rocks and sticks and pellets and saws and hammers and drills a whole lot of junk yes it was messy yes it was risky those nervous parents but it was freedom freedom because of the possibilities they had access to this is the same container we sent down to a community of children recovering from the worst bushfires in recent memory as a container got delivered and i opened up the doors i stood on the outskirts of that beautiful chaos and one boy came running past and he said i can't believe you're letting us do this i said do what he said let us have fun let us have fun as parents and caretakers if we endeavor to create environments where children get to have a childhood experience through time freedom and possibilities our first step is permission permission not only just to have a childhood but permission for ourselves to take a step back trust in their decision making and their capabilities you remember earlier when i asked you where you played as a child who thought outdoors yeah and who thought a tree and put your hand up if you got hurt sometimes yeah and i know you're all sitting there smiling and that tells me two things it tells me it was a memorable sp experience and a positive one and it's that experience paired with nature that has created that positive memory that you're reflecting on right now and that tree you're engaging with offers a beautiful illustration for how children learn through challenge the child engages with that tree and they start to climb their little bodies are flooded with positive endorphins running through their bodies that motivate them to climb higher reach beyond what they thought was possible and that effort is rewarded when they look up and see the whole world of new possibilities open up around them and when they fall because they will because we all know that's a part of life it's those same positive endorphins coursing through their bodies that inspire them to stand up dust themselves off and try again we all know it is the victories that we have in life during the most challenging of times that are the most rewarding and every time we over protect our children we're stripping away that reward and we're stealing their joy of self-fulfillment free play offers this beautiful arena where they can discover themselves children need to learn through doing not only by being told and not only by being shown it's within this exploration where they discover and will create the learning of becoming a respectful compassionate and resilient adult and this is a building block of well-being in later life we all have a responsibility to create environments for all children to have childhood experiences through time freedom and possibilities and we we can't do the growing for them but we can help them to stay curious and to keep their feet swinging [Applause]
