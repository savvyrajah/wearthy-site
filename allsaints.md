Remember https://hub.wearthy.co/all-saints-case-study this is going to be referenced to you from a cold email.So we want the focus to be reviewing the page, and then only one call to action should exist, which is booking a discovery call. We don't need call to actions to other playgrounds or any sort of breadcrumbs, and it should take a similar form to the discovery page in terms of the top part, which is a really nice hero with an image of the playground. And then the heading and things below that. 

Background info on allstaints project 

The client approached us to design a play structure for older children (Years 3–6). The site already featured several mature trees, and the goal was to create a challenging, gross-motor-focused treehouse-style play space that made use of the existing natural elements.

Testimonial from the school 
great. The new playground has been a fantastic addition to our school! One of the standout features is the giant slide, which has quickly
become a favorite among the children. Its size and speed bring a real sense of excitement and joy to playtime.
Equally popular is the physical challenge aspect of the playground. The climbing structures, balance elements, and obstacle-style features encourage students
to test their strength, coordination, and confidence in a fun and safe environment. It’s wonderful to see so many children engaged, active, and smiling as they
explore the space.
Overall, the playground has not only enhanced outdoor play but also supports physical development and social interaction. A big win for our school
community!


The AllStaintsbefore file has the original. 
The allsaintscover image should be the image for the hero 

We should have on the page a testimonial, the brief, the before and after, a few pictures, and how it relates to our methodology, the ecology of play.

And then a call to action to book a discovery call.
