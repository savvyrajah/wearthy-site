## Integration Architecture

### Recommended: API-First Approach

**Flow:**
1. User fills form ‚Üí Client-side validation
2. JavaScript POSTs to `/api/hubspot/discovery-call`
3. Backend creates/updates HubSpot contact
4. Photos uploaded to HubSpot Files API
5. Return success
6. Hide form, show embedded calendar with credibility sidebar

**Why API over Embedded Form:**
- ‚úÖ Full control over UX
- ‚úÖ Can handle file uploads
- ‚úÖ Custom validation
- ‚úÖ No iframe/embed issues
- ‚úÖ Better mobile experience

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Custom Properties (API)
```bash
POST https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/properties/contacts
# Create all 6 custom properties listed above
```

### 2. Add HubSpot Tracking Code
```html
<!-- Add to BaseLayout.astro <head> -->
<script type="text/javascript" id="hs-script-loader" async defer src="//js.hs-scripts.com/441564870.js"></script>
```

### 3. Build API Endpoint
```javascript
// File: pages/api/hubspot/discovery-call.js (or .ts)
export async function POST(request) {
  // 1. Parse form data + files
  // 2. Create/update contact in HubSpot
  // 3. Upload photos to HubSpot
  // 4. Return meeting scheduler URL
}
```

### 4. Update Form Submission
```javascript
// Replace alert() with:
fetch('/api/hubspot/discovery-call', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
}).then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Hide form
    // Show embedded calendar + credibility sidebar
    // No redirect - keeps user on site (no bounce)
  });
```

### 5. File Upload Handling
- Use HubSpot Files API
- Or store in your S3/storage + link in notes
- Attach file URLs to contact record

### 6. Meeting Scheduler Setup

**Flora's Meeting Link:** https://meetings-ap1.hubspot.com/flora

**Embedded Calendar Approach:**
After form submission, transform the page to show:

**Layout:**

> "The new playground has been a fantastic addition to our school! One of the standout features is the giant slide, which has quickly become a favorite among the children. Its size and speed bring a real sense of excitement and joy to playtime.
>
> Equally popular is the physical challenge aspect of the playground. The climbing structures, balance elements, and obstacle-style features encourage students to test their strength, coordination, and confidence in a fun and safe environment. It's wonderful to see so many children engaged, active, and smiling as they explore the space.

> Overall, the playground has not only enhanced outdoor play but also supports physical development and social interaction. A big win for our school community!"
